## ðŸ§  Context Restoration

### Key Files to Review:

1. `documentation/PRD.md` - What we're building
2. `documentation/UIDD.md` - How it should look
3. `documentation/decisions.md` - Tech choices made
4. `documentation/current-status.md` - What's actually done

### User Preferences (from memories):

- Card modals for new records (not full pages) [[memory:3822843]]
- Auto-select new records after creation [[memory:3822854]]
- Color-coded expiration indicators [[memory:3487975]]
- Automatic field naming conventions [[memory:3675279]]

### Architecture Reminders:

- **Database**: PostgreSQL only, no SQLite
- **Framework**: Next.js 14, no major upgrades
- **Authentication**: Clerk with RBAC
- **UI**: ShadCN + Tailwind, "new-york" style
- **Data Model**: Party-based (Organization, Person, Equipment)

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Priority

**Phase**: Initial Foundation Setup
**Next**: Environment â†’ Database â†’ UI Components â†’ Auth â†’ App Shell
