## Overview

Roadside Inspections (RINS) represent a critical compliance management feature that handles DOT roadside inspection incidents. Unlike other driver issues that track expiration dates, RINS are **reactive, incident-based records** that document inspection events, violations, and required corrective actions.

### Key Differentiators
- **Incident-based** (not expiration tracking)
- **Multi-party relationships** (driver, equipment, violations)
- **Complex violation workflows** with out-of-service tracking
- **Corrective Action Form (CAF) generation**
- **Organization-level display** with drill-down capabilities
- **FMCSA integration** potential for automation

---

## Business Requirements

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Manual DVER Entry** - Input Driver/Vehicle Examination Reports from roadside inspections
2. **Violation Documentation** - Record specific DOT violations with inspector comments
3. **Out-of-Service Management** - Track equipment/driver OOS status and remedy dates
4. **Corrective Action Tracking** - Generate and assign CAFs to appropriate staff
5. **Compliance Reporting** - Organization-level view of inspection history and trends

### Stakeholder Needs
- **Compliance Managers** - Quick overview of inspection incidents and violation trends
- **Safety Directors** - Detailed violation analysis and corrective action status
- **Drivers** - Access to their inspection history and required actions
- **Maintenance Teams** - Equipment-specific violations and OOS tracking
- **Consultants** - Multi-organization inspection management

### Regulatory Context
- **49 CFR Part 350-399** - Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations
- **CVSA Standards** - Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance inspection procedures
- **State DOT Requirements** - Varies by jurisdiction
- **FMCSA DataQs Portal** - Future integration for automated data retrieval

---

## Workflow & User Experience

POST   /                    # Create new inspection
GET    /:id                 # Get specific inspection with details
PUT    /:id                 # Update inspection (full replace)
DELETE /:id                 # Soft delete inspection
```

### Data Flow
```
Form Submission â†’ Validation â†’ API Route â†’ Database Transaction:
â”œâ”€â”€ Create/Update roadside_inspection_issue
â”œâ”€â”€ Delete existing rins_equipment_involvement
â”œâ”€â”€ Create new equipment records (with fetched details)
â”œâ”€â”€ Delete existing rins_violation
â”œâ”€â”€ Create new violation records (with full metadata)
â””â”€â”€ Return complete inspection with relations
```

### Access Control (RBAC)
```
Access Hierarchy:
â”œâ”€â”€ Direct Ownership (party.userId === currentUserId)
â”œâ”€â”€ Master Consultant (manages all organizations)
â”œâ”€â”€ Organization Manager (manages organization drivers/equipment)
â”œâ”€â”€ Location Manager (manages location-specific staff)
â””â”€â”€ Driver Self-Access (own inspection records only)
```

### State Management
```
Frontend State:
â”œâ”€â”€ selectedInspection (master-detail UI)
â”œâ”€â”€ inspectionsList (filtered by context)
â”œâ”€â”€ organizations (for selector)

## Violation Management System

### Violation Database
**Source:** 49 CFR Parts 390-399 (Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations)

**Categories:**
- **390.x** - General Company/Administrative (4 violations)
- **391.x** - Driver Qualification (6 violations)
- **392.x** - Driver Performance/Behavior (8 violations)
- **393.x** - Equipment/Vehicle Safety (12 violations)
- **396.x** - Inspection, Repair, and Maintenance (5 violations)

**Total:** 40+ common violations with complete metadata

### Search Algorithm
```javascript
function searchViolations(query) {
  return VIOLATION_CODES.filter(violation => 
    violation.code.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
    violation.description.toLowerCase().includes(query) ||
    violation.section.toLowerCase().includes(query)
  ).slice(0, 10) // Performance limit
}
```

### Violation Metadata
```javascript
interface ViolationCode {
  code: string          // "392.2A"
  section: string       // "49 CFR 392.2A"
  description: string   // "Ill or fatigued operator"
  violationType: string // "DRIVER"
  severity: string      // "OUT_OF_SERVICE"
}
```

### Out-of-Service Workflow
1. **Violation Selection** â†’ Auto-sets OOS if violation severity is "OUT_OF_SERVICE"
2. **OOS Toggle** â†’ Enables OOS date fields
3. **OOS Date** â†’ Required, defaults to inspection date
4. **Back-in-Service Date** â†’ Optional, set when remedied
5. **Validation** â†’ Ensures OOS date provided for all OOS violations

## Decision Log

### January 27, 2025 - Phase 1A Implementation Decisions

**Decision 1: Organization-Level Entry First**
- **Context:** Multiple potential entry points (driver, equipment, organization, location)
- **Decision:** Implement organization-level entry first, expand in Phase 1B
- **Rationale:** Simplifies initial implementation while covering primary use case
- **Impact:** Faster delivery, requires future enhancement for other contexts

**Decision 2: Live Violation Search vs. Static List**
- **Context:** How to handle 1000+ possible DOT violation codes
- **Decision:** Implement live search with curated 40+ common violations
- **Rationale:** Better UX than checkboxes, covers 80% of real-world violations
- **Impact:** Requires violation database maintenance, excellent user experience

**Decision 3: Equipment Details Storage Strategy**
- **Context:** Equipment details may change over time, affecting historical accuracy
- **Decision:** Store equipment details in `rins_equipment_involvement` at time of inspection
- **Rationale:** Preserves historical accuracy for compliance and reporting
- **Impact:** Larger database footprint, better data integrity

**Decision 4: Out-of-Service Date Management**
- **Context:** How to handle OOS dates for violations and equipment/drivers
- **Decision:** Start with violation-level OOS dates, defer equipment/driver OOS tracking
- **Rationale:** Simpler implementation, covers immediate compliance needs
- **Impact:** May need future enhancement for comprehensive OOS management

**Decision 5: Violation Comment Requirements**
- **Context:** Should inspector comments be required for all violations?
- **Decision:** Require inspector comments for all violations
- **Rationale:** Essential for compliance documentation and future CAF generation
- **Impact:** Enforces data quality, may slow data entry slightly

**Decision 6: Form Validation Strategy**
- **Context:** Client-side vs. server-side validation approach
- **Decision:** Implement both client-side (UX) and server-side (security) validation
- **Rationale:** Best user experience with robust data integrity
- **Impact:** Additional development effort, better overall system reliability

**Decision 7: RBAC Implementation**
- **Context:** Access control complexity for multi-level organizations
- **Decision:** Copy proven RBAC pattern from other issue types
- **Rationale:** Consistent security model, faster implementation
- **Impact:** Reliable access control, easier maintenance
