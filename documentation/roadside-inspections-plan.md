## Overview

Roadside Inspections (RINS) represent a critical compliance management feature that handles DOT roadside inspection incidents. Unlike other driver issues that track expiration dates, RINS are **reactive, incident-based records** that document inspection events, violations, and required corrective actions.

### Key Differentiators
- **Incident-based** (not expiration tracking)
- **Multi-party relationships** (driver, equipment, violations)
- **Complex violation workflows** with out-of-service tracking
- **Corrective Action Form (CAF) generation**
- **Organization-level display** with drill-down capabilities
- **FMCSA integration** potential for automation

---

## Business Requirements

### Primary Use Cases
1. **Manual DVER Entry** - Input Driver/Vehicle Examination Reports from roadside inspections
2. **Violation Documentation** - Record specific DOT violations with inspector comments
3. **Out-of-Service Management** - Track equipment/driver OOS status and remedy dates
4. **Corrective Action Tracking** - Generate and assign CAFs to appropriate staff
5. **Compliance Reporting** - Organization-level view of inspection history and trends

### Stakeholder Needs
- **Compliance Managers** - Quick overview of inspection incidents and violation trends
- **Safety Directors** - Detailed violation analysis and corrective action status
- **Drivers** - Access to their inspection history and required actions
- **Maintenance Teams** - Equipment-specific violations and OOS tracking
- **Consultants** - Multi-organization inspection management

### Regulatory Context
- **49 CFR Part 350-399** - Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations
- **CVSA Standards** - Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance inspection procedures
- **State DOT Requirements** - Varies by jurisdiction
- **FMCSA DataQs Portal** - Future integration for automated data retrieval

---

## DVER Automation System

### Overview
The Driver/Vehicle Examination Report (DVER) automation system represents a revolutionary advancement in roadside inspection data entry. Built on sophisticated OCR technology and intelligent field mapping, this system automatically converts physical DVER documents into digital RSIN records with minimal manual intervention.

### Architecture Components

#### **DVERProcessor Class**
Core processing engine with configurable OCR providers:

```typescript
interface DVERProcessor {
  // OCR Provider Configuration
  provider: 'AWS_TEXTRACT' | 'GOOGLE_VISION' | 'AZURE_FORM_RECOGNIZER'
  confidence_threshold: number
  
  // Image Preprocessing
  preprocessing: {
    deskew: boolean           // Correct document orientation
    noise_reduction: boolean  // Remove scan artifacts
    contrast_enhancement: boolean // Improve text clarity
  }
}
```

#### **Field Mapping System**
Pattern-based extraction using keyword recognition:

```typescript
const DVER_FIELD_MAPPINGS = {
  // Header Information
  report_number: { keywords: ['Report', 'Number', 'USP'] },
  inspection_date: { keywords: ['Date', 'Inspection'] },
  inspector_name: { keywords: ['Inspector', 'Name', 'Officer'] },
  
  // Equipment Sections (repeating)
  unit_sections: {
    keywords: ['Unit', 'Vehicle', 'Equipment'],
    fields: {
      unit_type: ['Type', 'TT', 'TLR'],
      make: ['Make', 'Manufacturer'],
      vin: ['VIN', 'Serial']
    }
  }
}
```

#### **Data Validation Engine**
Business rule validation and data cleaning:
- **Required Field Defaults** - Auto-populate missing required fields

### Technical Implementation Plan

#### **Database Integration**
```sql
-- Link RSIN records to Activity Log
ALTER TABLE roadside_inspection_issue 
ADD COLUMN primary_activity_log_id TEXT REFERENCES activity_log(id);

-- Store DVER processing metadata
CREATE TABLE dver_processing_log (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  rsin_id TEXT REFERENCES roadside_inspection_issue(id),
  dver_file_activity_id TEXT REFERENCES activity_log(id),
  ocr_provider TEXT,
  confidence_score DECIMAL,
  fields_extracted INTEGER,
  processing_time_seconds INTEGER,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### **Component Integration**
```typescript
// Enhanced RSIN Form with Activity Log
<RSINForm rsinId={rsin.id}>
  <ActivityLog 
    issueId={rsin.issueId}
    allowedTypes={['attachment', 'communication', 'note', 'task']}
    defaultTags={[
      'inspection', 
      rsin.inspectionLevel.toLowerCase(),
      rsin.overallResult.toLowerCase()
    ]}
  />
</RSINForm>
```

#### **DVER Upload Enhancement**
```typescript
// Enhanced DVER Upload with Activity Logging
const handleDVERUpload = async (file: File) => {
  // 1. Create attachment activity for original DVER
  const dverActivity = await createActivity({
    type: 'attachment',
    title: 'DVER Document Upload',
    file: file,
    tags: ['dver', 'original', 'processing']
  })
  
  // 2. Process DVER with OCR
  const processedData = await processDVER(file)
  
  // 3. Log processing results
  await createActivity({
    type: 'note',
    title: 'DVER Processing Complete',
    content: `Extracted ${processedData.fieldsCount} fields with ${processedData.confidence}% confidence`,
    tags: ['ocr', 'automated', 'processing-complete']
  })
  
  // 4. Create RSIN with activity log reference
  const rsin = await createRSIN({
    ...processedData,
    primaryActivityLogId: dverActivity.id
  })
}
```

## Decision Log

### January 27, 2025 - Phase 1A Implementation Decisions

**Decision 1: Organization-Level Entry First**
- **Context:** Multiple potential entry points (driver, equipment, organization, location)
- **Decision:** Implement organization-level entry first, expand in Phase 1B
- **Rationale:** Simplifies initial implementation while covering primary use case
- **Impact:** Faster delivery, requires future enhancement for other contexts

**Decision 2: Live Violation Search vs. Static List**
- **Context:** How to handle 1000+ possible DOT violation codes
- **Decision:** Implement live search with curated 40+ common violations
- **Rationale:** Better UX than checkboxes, covers 80% of real-world violations
- **Impact:** Requires violation database maintenance, excellent user experience

**Decision 3: Equipment Details Storage Strategy**
- **Context:** Equipment details may change over time, affecting historical accuracy
- **Decision:** Store equipment details in `rins_equipment_involvement` at time of inspection
- **Rationale:** Preserves historical accuracy for compliance and reporting
- **Impact:** Larger database footprint, better data integrity

**Decision 4: Out-of-Service Date Management**
- **Context:** How to handle OOS dates for violations and equipment/drivers
- **Decision:** Start with violation-level OOS dates, defer equipment/driver OOS tracking
- **Rationale:** Simpler implementation, covers immediate compliance needs
- **Impact:** May need future enhancement for comprehensive OOS management

**Decision 5: Violation Comment Requirements**
- **Context:** Should inspector comments be required for all violations?
- **Decision:** Require inspector comments for all violations
- **Rationale:** Essential for compliance documentation and future CAF generation
- **Impact:** Enforces data quality, may slow data entry slightly

**Decision 6: Form Validation Strategy**
- **Context:** Client-side vs. server-side validation approach
- **Decision:** Implement both client-side (UX) and server-side (security) validation
- **Rationale:** Best user experience with robust data integrity
- **Impact:** Additional development effort, better overall system reliability

**Decision 7: RBAC Implementation**
- **Context:** Access control complexity for multi-level organizations
- **Decision:** Copy proven RBAC pattern from other issue types
