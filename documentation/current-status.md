## Current Architecture

### Database Model
- **Party-based architecture**: All entities (Organization, Location, Person, Equipment) use party model
- **Role relationships**: Flexible role system for managing relationships between parties
- **Organization hierarchy**: Master â†’ Organizations â†’ Locations â†’ Drivers/Equipment
- **Access control**: Comprehensive permission system based on party relationships
- **Issue tracking**: Base issue system with extensible specific issue types

### Frontend Architecture
- **AppLayout pattern**: Consistent layout across all pages
- **Contextual navigation**: Smart top nav based on user role and access path
- **Tab-based content**: Details | Drivers | Equipment | Locations structure
- **Modal patterns**: Consistent edit/add functionality across entities
- **Real-time KPIs**: Live counts and metrics displayed on dashboards

### API Design
- **RESTful endpoints**: Standard CRUD operations for all entities
- **Advanced access control**: Master users can access all orgs, org users limited to their scope
- **Party model integration**: All entities properly linked through party relationships
- **Transaction safety**: Database operations use transactions for data consistency

## Compliance Requirements Documentation

### **ðŸ“‹ NEW: Comprehensive Issue Type Mapping**
See `documentation/compliance-requirements.md` for complete breakdown:

#### **Organization Issues** (16 specific requirements)
- Operating Authority & Registration (DOT, MC, State permits)
- Insurance & Financial Responsibility (Liability, Cargo, Workers Comp)
- Safety & Compliance Programs (Drug testing, Driver qualification)
- Regulatory Filings (Biennial updates, Process agents)

#### **Driver Issues** (20+ specific requirements)
- Commercial Driver's License (CDL with endorsements)
- Medical Certification (DOT Physical, Medical variance)
- Drug & Alcohol Compliance (Testing program participation)
- Training & Qualification Records (ELDT, Hazmat, Safety)
- Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) monitoring
- Incident Management (RSIN, Accidents, Citations)

#### **Equipment Issues** (15+ specific requirements)
- Vehicle Registration & Licensing (State registration, IFTA)
- Annual Inspections (AIN) (DOT annual, State inspections)
- Insurance & Financial Requirements (Vehicle, Cargo coverage)
- Maintenance & Safety Records (Preventive maintenance)
- Specialized Equipment Compliance (Tank, Crane, Reefer)
- Roadside Inspection Results (RSIN violations and corrections)

## User Experience Patterns

### Navigation Contexts
1. **Master User**: Full hierarchy navigation (Master | Organization | Drivers | Equipment)
2. **Organization Manager**: Organization scope (Organization | Drivers | Equipment)  
3. **Location Manager**: Location scope (Location | Drivers | Equipment)

### Page Structures
- **Organization Page**: Name row + Tabs (Details | Locations | Staff) + KPIs
- **Location Page**: Name row + Tabs (Details | Drivers | Equipment) + KPIs
- **Management Pages**: Add button + List/Grid + Edit modals
- **Future Issue Pages**: Issue lists + Detail modals + Corrective action workflows

### Data Filtering
- **Organization level**: All drivers/equipment for the organization
- **Location level**: Only drivers/equipment assigned to that specific location
- **Role-based access**: Users only see data they have permission to access

## Technical Debt & Known Issues
- **Equipment form**: Needs additional vehicle specification fields (planned for future)
- **Staff vs Driver**: Clear separation implemented, but staff management needs more features
- **Contact information**: Simplified to single entries, multiple contacts planned for separate tables
- **TypeScript interfaces**: Some type conflicts between different Organization interfaces need cleanup

## Next Development Priorities

### **ðŸŽ¯ Immediate (License Management)**
1. **License API Development**: `/api/licenses` endpoints for CRUD operations
2. **License UI Components**: License list, add/edit modals, expiration tracking
3. **CDL Management**: Commercial driver's license tracking with endorsements
4. **DOT Physical Tracking**: Medical certificate management with alerts

### **ðŸš€ Short-term (Core Compliance)**
5. **Registration System**: Vehicle registration and permit tracking
6. **Inspection Management**: AIN annual inspections and RSIN incident workflows
7. **Contact System**: Multiple phone/email/address management per entity (architecture complete)
8. **Document Storage**: File upload system for certificates and documentation

### **ðŸ“Š Medium-term (Workflow & Alerts)**
9. **Alert System**: Automated expiration notifications and escalation
10. **Training Records**: Training certificate and qualification tracking
11. **Maintenance System**: Equipment maintenance scheduling and tracking
12. **Corrective Actions**: Violation workflow and resolution tracking

## Testing Status
- [x] Manual testing of all CRUD operations
- [x] Navigation flow testing across all user roles
- [x] Access control verification
- [x] Modal functionality testing
- [ ] Automated testing suite (not implemented)
- [ ] End-to-end testing (not implemented)
