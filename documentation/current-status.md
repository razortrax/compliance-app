### ðŸ”´ Not Started - Compliance Management
- [ ] License management system (license_issue table)
- [ ] Annual Inspection (AIN) tracking
- [ ] Roadside Inspection (RSIN) incident management
- [ ] MVR (Motor Vehicle Record) tracking
- [ ] Drug & Alcohol compliance
- [ ] Physical/Medical certificate tracking
- [ ] Training record management
- [ ] Accident incident management
- [ ] Registration management (registration_issue table)
- [ ] Maintenance tracking
- [ ] Issue expiration alerts and notifications

### ðŸ”´ Not Started - Advanced Features
- [ ] Contact management (multiple phone/email/address entries)
- [ ] Document management and file uploads
- [ ] Audit trail and compliance reporting
- [ ] Bulk import/export functionality
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] Advanced search and filtering
- [ ] Data analytics and compliance dashboards
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness optimization

## Current Architecture

### Database Model
- **Party-based architecture**: All entities (Organization, Location, Person, Equipment) use party model
- **Role relationships**: Flexible role system for managing relationships between parties
- **Organization hierarchy**: Master â†’ Organizations â†’ Locations â†’ Drivers/Equipment
- **Access control**: Comprehensive permission system based on party relationships

### Frontend Architecture
- **AppLayout pattern**: Consistent layout across all pages
- **Contextual navigation**: Smart top nav based on user role and access path
- **Tab-based content**: Details | Drivers | Equipment | Locations structure
- **Modal patterns**: Consistent edit/add functionality across entities
- **Real-time KPIs**: Live counts and metrics displayed on dashboards

### API Design
- **RESTful endpoints**: Standard CRUD operations for all entities
- **Advanced access control**: Master users can access all orgs, org users limited to their scope
- **Party model integration**: All entities properly linked through party relationships
- **Transaction safety**: Database operations use transactions for data consistency

## User Experience Patterns

### Navigation Contexts
1. **Master User**: Full hierarchy navigation (Master | Organization | Drivers | Equipment)
2. **Organization Manager**: Organization scope (Organization | Drivers | Equipment)  
3. **Location Manager**: Location scope (Location | Drivers | Equipment)

### Page Structures
- **Organization Page**: Name row + Tabs (Details | Locations | Staff) + KPIs
- **Location Page**: Name row + Tabs (Details | Drivers | Equipment) + KPIs
- **Management Pages**: Add button + List/Grid + Edit modals

### Data Filtering
- **Organization level**: All drivers/equipment for the organization
- **Location level**: Only drivers/equipment assigned to that specific location
- **Role-based access**: Users only see data they have permission to access

## Technical Debt & Known Issues
- **Equipment form**: Needs additional vehicle specification fields (planned for future)
- **Staff vs Driver**: Clear separation implemented, but staff management needs more features
- **Contact information**: Simplified to single entries, multiple contacts planned for separate tables
- **TypeScript interfaces**: Some type conflicts between different Organization interfaces need cleanup

## Next Development Priorities
1. **License Management**: Implement license_issue table and tracking system
2. **Inspection Framework**: Build AIN and RSIN systems with violation workflows  
3. **Contact Management**: Multiple phone/email/address tables
4. **Document Storage**: File upload and attachment system
5. **Compliance Alerts**: Expiration tracking and notification system

## Testing Status
- [x] Manual testing of all CRUD operations
- [x] Navigation flow testing across all user roles
- [x] Access control verification
- [x] Modal functionality testing
- [ ] Automated testing suite (not implemented)
- [ ] End-to-end testing (not implemented)
