# Integration Roadmap - Phase 2 Development

*Created: January 31, 2025*

## Overview

Post-MVP integration strategy to streamline compliance processes, enhance data accuracy, and create additional revenue streams through strategic partnerships and API integrations.

## Priority Integrations

### **1. FMCSA.gov Portal Integration** 🎯 **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Purpose**: Automated DVIR (Driver Vehicle Inspection Report) retrieval and monitoring
**Business Impact**: Prevent missed roadside inspections that trigger DOT audits

#### Implementation Details
- **Data Source**: FMCSA.gov portal (public data only - no organization-specific API)
- **Process**: Weekly automated review of publicly available DVIR data
- **Critical Need**: Organizations often miss roadside inspections when drivers fail to report them
- **Compliance Benefit**: Ensures timely corrective action workflow initiation

#### Technical Approach
- **Phase 1**: Manual portal monitoring and data entry
- **Phase 2**: Automated scraping/monitoring system (compliance with FMCSA terms)
- **Phase 3**: Direct API integration if/when available

#### Note on Terminology
**CORRECTION**: Documentation has incorrectly used "DVER" - should be "DVIR" (Driver Vehicle Inspection Report)
- Update all references from DVER → DVIR
- Maintain backward compatibility in code where needed

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Basic VIN decode API integration for make/model/year auto-population
- **Phase 2**: Advanced vehicle specifications and safety data integration  
- **Phase 3**: Real-time recall checking and safety alert integration

#### Technical Details
- **API Endpoint**: `https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/decodevin/{VIN}?format=json`
- **Rate Limits**: Free government service, reasonable usage expected
- **Data Quality**: Official NHTSA database, highly accurate for US vehicles
- **Legacy Experience**: Previously implemented in FileMaker version with web scraping

#### Business Value
- **Time Savings**: Eliminate manual equipment data entry
