# Integration Roadmap - Phase 2 Development

*Created: January 31, 2025*

## Overview

Post-MVP integration strategy to streamline compliance processes, enhance data accuracy, and create additional revenue streams through strategic partnerships and API integrations.

## Priority Integrations

### **1. FMCSA.gov Portal Integration** ðŸŽ¯ **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Purpose**: Automated DVIR (Driver Vehicle Inspection Report) retrieval and monitoring
**Business Impact**: Prevent missed roadside inspections that trigger DOT audits

#### Implementation Details
- **Data Source**: FMCSA.gov portal (public data only - no organization-specific API)
- **Process**: Weekly automated review of publicly available DVIR data
- **Critical Need**: Organizations often miss roadside inspections when drivers fail to report them
- **Compliance Benefit**: Ensures timely corrective action workflow initiation

#### Technical Approach
- **Phase 1**: Manual portal monitoring and data entry
- **Phase 2**: Automated scraping/monitoring system (compliance with FMCSA terms)
- **Phase 3**: Direct API integration if/when available

#### Note on Terminology
**CORRECTION**: Documentation has incorrectly used "DVER" - should be "DVIR" (Driver Vehicle Inspection Report)
- Update all references from DVER â†’ DVIR
- Maintain backward compatibility in code where needed

- **Advanced**: Mileage-based scheduling with Motive API integration
- **Intelligent**: Predictive maintenance based on usage patterns

---

### **6. DVIR Auto-Population System** ðŸ“„ **INTELLIGENT DOCUMENT PROCESSING**
**Purpose**: Automatic RSIN creation from uploaded DVIR documents using OCR
**Status**: Built and ready for OCR integration

#### Core Business Logic
- **Driver & Equipment**: Must exist in Fleetrax before DVIR processing
- **Inspector & Agency**: Auto-created as external staff/organizations
- **Missing Records**: User notified and must add required records first
- **Data Validation**: Ensures compliance workflow integrity

#### Auto-Population Features
- **OCR Document Processing**: Extract structured data from DVIR PDFs
- **Intelligent Matching**: Match drivers by license, equipment by VIN
- **External Party Creation**: Auto-create Inspector and Agency records
- **Pre-Population**: Auto-fill RSIN forms with extracted data
- **Violation Detection**: Extract and match DOT violation codes
- **Attachment Linking**: Link original DVIR document to RSIN

#### Implementation Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Enhanced mock data testing (COMPLETE)
- **Phase 2**: OCR service integration (AWS Textract recommended)
- **Phase 3**: UI integration with upload button next to "New RSIN"
- **Phase 4**: Batch processing for multiple DVIR documents

#### Business Workflow
```
1. User uploads DVIR document
2. OCR extracts structured data
3. System checks for existing Driver/Equipment records
   â†’ If missing: Display required records, block processing
   â†’ If found: Continue to step 4
4. Auto-create Inspector/Agency records (if new)
5. Pre-populate RSIN form with extracted data
6. User reviews and submits RSIN
7. Link original DVIR as attachment
```

#### Technical Implementation
- **OCR Services**: AWS Textract (primary), Google Vision (fallback)
- **Data Extraction**: `DVIRProcessor` class with parsing logic
- **Record Checking**: `checkAndCreateExternalRecordsFromDVIR()`
- **Form Pre-Population**: `createIncidentFromDVIR()`
- **File Management**: DigitalOcean Spaces for DVIR storage

#### Cost Structure
- **AWS Textract**: $1.50 per 1,000 pages (Free tier: 1,000/month)
- **Google Vision**: $1.50 per 1,000 pages (Free tier: 1,000/month)
- **Monthly Estimates**: 100 DVIRs = $0.15, 1,000 DVIRs = $1.50

#### Data Quality & Compliance
- **Driver Validation**: Ensures proper onboarding before inspections
- **Equipment Validation**: Prevents orphaned inspection records
- **Inspector Tracking**: Complete audit trail for DOT officials
- **Document Linking**: Original DVIR always attached to RSIN

#### Testing & Development
