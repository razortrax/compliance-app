## 📋 **RSIN Management Workflow: Your Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Phase 1: Lightning-Fast RSIN Creation**

#### **Step 1: Access Your Command Center**

Navigate to: **Master Dashboard → Organization → Drivers → [Driver Name] → Roadside Inspections**

_Notice how Fleetrax contextualizes everything. No hunting through generic menus—we know exactly who you're working with and what you need._

#### **Step 2: Create New RSIN with Intelligent Forms**

   - **Company CAFs** → Operations/Safety manager
3. **Auto-Numbering:** Sequential CAF numbers with organizational prefixes
