## Why PostgreSQL on DigitalOcean?

Supabase caused persistent issues during early dev. DigitalOcean PostgreSQL is stable, scalable, and compatible with Prisma.

A party model treats people, organizations, and equipment as variations of a core "party" entity. This makes relationships between them easier to manage and future-proof.

## Why is Clerk used for auth?

Clerk offers built-in UI, JWT support, and role-based access control â€” all with zero backend setup. It aligns with the project's security needs.

## Why use Zustand instead of Redux?
