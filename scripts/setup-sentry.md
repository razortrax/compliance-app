# Sentry Setup for Fleetrax

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why Sentry for Equipment Development**

Sentry will be **invaluable** for Equipment Gold Standard implementation because:

- **Complex Equipment Logic**: Annual inspections, maintenance tracking, multi-driver relationships
- **NHTSA VPIC Integration**: API failures and data parsing issues
- **Performance Monitoring**: Equipment list filtering, search, and status calculations
- **Form State Management**: Complex equipment forms with file uploads
- **Compliance Calculations**: Equipment expiration dates and violation tracking

## ðŸ“‹ **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Create Free Sentry Account**

1. Go to **https://sentry.io/signup/**
2. Sign up with your **patrick@traxsys.ai** email
3. Create a new organization: **"TraxSys Inc"**
4. Create a new project: **"Fleetrax"**
5. Select platform: **"Next.js"**

### **Step 2: Get Your DSN**

After creating the project:

1. Go to **Settings > Projects > Fleetrax > Client Keys (DSN)**
2. Copy the **Public DSN** (starts with `https://...@sentry.io/...`)

### **Step 3: Add Environment Variables**

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Sentry Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=https://your-public-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_DSN=https://your-public-dsn@sentry.io/project-id
SENTRY_ORG=traxsys-inc
SENTRY_PROJECT=fleetrax

# Optional: For source map uploads in production
SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=your-auth-token-here
```

### **Step 4: Restart Development Server**

```bash
npm run dev
```

## ðŸ’° **Pricing & Upgrade Path**

### **Free Tier (Perfect for Now)**

- âœ… **5,000 errors/month** (generous for development + early customers)
- âœ… **1 team member** (perfect for solo development)
- âœ… **30-day error retention**
- âœ… **Performance monitoring**
- âœ… **Session replay**
- âœ… **Basic alerting**

### **When to Upgrade ($26/month)**

Only upgrade when you hit these limits:

- More than 5,000 errors/month
- Need more team members
- Want longer retention (90+ days)
- Need advanced features (custom dashboards)

**ROI**: One prevented customer churn pays for months of Sentry!

## ðŸ”§ **Usage in Development**

Sentry is already configured! It will automatically capture:

### **Equipment Development Errors**

```typescript
// Automatic capture in API routes
export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const equipment = await createEquipment(data);
    return Response.json(equipment);
  } catch (error) {
    // Sentry automatically captures this with full context!
    throw error;
  }
}
```

### **Manual Error Capture**

```typescript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/nextjs";

// Capture custom equipment errors
Sentry.captureException(error, {
  tags: {
    feature: "equipment-annual-inspection",
    organization: orgId,
    equipment: equipmentId,
  },
  user: { id: userId, email: userEmail },
  extra: {
    vinNumber: equipment.vinNumber,
    inspectionType: "annual",
  },
});

// Track equipment processing performance
const transaction = Sentry.startTransaction({
  name: "process-equipment-inspection",
});
// ... processing logic ...
transaction.finish();
```

### **NHTSA VPIC Integration Monitoring**

```typescript
// Monitor VIN decoder API calls
try {
  const vinData = await fetch(`https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/api/vehicles/DecodeVin/${vin}`);
  const data = await vinData.json();
} catch (error) {
  Sentry.captureException(error, {
    tags: { feature: "nhtsa-vpic-integration" },
    extra: { vin: vin },
  });
}
```

## ðŸš¨ **Critical for Compliance**

Equipment issues involve **regulatory compliance**. Small bugs can have big consequences:

- **DOT Inspections**: Failed equipment tracking = audit failures
- **Maintenance Records**: Missing data = violations
- **Driver Assignments**: Wrong equipment = compliance gaps

Sentry ensures you catch issues before they affect your customers' compliance.

## ðŸ“Š **Dashboard Access**

Once configured, access your Sentry dashboard at:
**https://sentry.io/organizations/traxsys-inc/projects/fleetrax/**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next Steps**

1. âœ… **Sentry is already configured** in your codebase
2. ðŸ”„ **Sign up** at sentry.io using the instructions above
3. ðŸ”‘ **Add your DSN** to `.env.local`
4. ðŸš€ **Start developing** Equipment features with confidence!

Sentry will immediately start capturing errors and performance data as you build Equipment Gold Standard features.
